 <h2>Welcome to a glimpse of my life and adventures!</h2>
 <p>Hello! My name is Brooke Hutchinson. (On the right) My wife is Katherine (Left). I was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2015 at just 25 years old. Long story short, I almost died before they caught it and had to have my bladder removed. I was clear for five years until 2021. At that time, my cancer recurred, and I faced this disease again. I had my left kidney removed and then found out it was in my spine. As time went on, I was informed it was also in my ribs, lungs, and brain. I am terminal, and this was quite a shock to my family. Now, at 33 years old, my wife and I face the impossible. In the Fall of 2022, many supporters made a dream "bucket list" East Coast trip of mine come true. My wife and I and our two pups set out across the east coast in a rented RV. We are paranormal investigators on the side and spent a lot of our time hitting places we never thought we could. We also visited the 9/11 museum in NYC, Boston, Maine, Niagra Falls,The Lizzie Borden House, The Ohio State Reformatory, Transalegheny Lunatic Asylum, Salem, The Mothman Museum, The Mutter Museum, etc. It was amazing! The photo here is us at one of those paranormal spots called the Lake Shawnee Amusement park in Virginia. Some of you may have heard the stories behind this place on various TV shows. For almost three weeks, we traveled, shopped, ate, drank, and experienced what each state had to offer. This was an amazing trip, and sharing it with you is a joy.</p>
